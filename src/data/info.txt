Here is a brief description of the path from raw NGSIM data to model.

- feature_set.txt contains the extracted features from the filtered NGSIM dataset
- df_all.txt is raw data for the entire dataset.
- lc episodes are extracted for x4 cars. These are m_df, y_df, f_df and fadj_df.
- These data files are then trimmed and saved as states_arr and targets_arr by
data_preliminaries.py to be further processed/sequenced prior to training by
data_prep.py
