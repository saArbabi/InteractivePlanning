1- models are evaluated using RWSE. The RWSE errors for each model are dumped
in the model folder.

2- planner is only evaluated qualitatively. The env.py module is used for
..



"""
This class uses the test dataset and MC technique for model evaluation.
Steps for MC evaluation a given model is as follows:
() read the eval_config file. This determines what mc experiments need to be run for
which model.
(1) load the testset for a given traffic desity. EvalDataObj contains the test data.
() divide the testset into snippets: past states and future states
() scale and then feed the testset to the model to compute actions
() turn the plans to states of interest (forward_sim)
() dump collected states for all the vehicels of interest in their respective model folders.
    depending on the model, different rwse metrics are collected
() you can now compute rwse for different models in ./publication/quantitative


    - rwse
        - high denstiy
            - veh_m
                - long. speed
                - lat. speed
            - veh_y
            - veh_f
            - veh_fadj
        - medium denstiy
        - random denstiy (for evaluating influence of sequence length and step size )

Note: random seeds are set to ensure repeatable MC runs.
